            <p>AI is a fresh field for everyone. And venturing into the unknown can sometimes be frustrating&#44; and rightly so! Mastering new skills is always challenging&#44; especially in a field that is so new to the world. AI not only provides value to a person&#39;s daily work flow&#44; but they also can impact and aid in almost anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                This semester&#44; I had the opportunity to interview five people with varying levels of experience with AI: Bella&#44; with experience working with AI in her daily workflow&#44; Anthony&#44; a ChatGPT connoisseur&#44; Francesca&#44; a complete novice to everything AI&#44; Michael&#44; a on-and-off AI user&#44; and Alexa&#44; someone that has used it before but not in-the-know with technology. I learned from their perspectives how AI affects their daily lives&#44; why they continue to be users&#39; and what they see for the future of AI. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The specifics of what I learned from each individual are located in their articles &#40;User Interviews&#41;&#44; now&#44; I am focused on reflecting on the experience of broadening my perspective on AI by looking at others&#39; perspectives on AI. As a product designer&#44; I do not shy away from AI and it has only positively impacted my daily workflow. Whether that be creating lists and ideas for me on a less-creative day&#44; or a programming question when my professor is unavailable. There are various avenues or situations in which I have chosen to use AI and&#44; sometimes&#44; there are issues&#44; but without issues&#44; you would not learn how to properly debug and understand what to say and what not to say to get an output that satisfies your input. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking to people who have different experiences with AI has made me realize that AI can serve and help with so many things and it is not a mutually exclusive tool to any field of study. There is an aspect of having some &#39;artistic freedom&#39; when you open that chatbot and all that is there is a text box for you to write whatever comes to mind. Also&#44; something I knew before&#44; but have gotten a deeper understanding of throughout this process is the ability to talk to a chatbot effectively and the vernacular required to get the output you are expecting.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it wasn&#39;t for both my coworkers and the influx of the use of AI lately&#44; I wouldn't have done this topic. So I truly have tothank the zeitgeist for bringing AI to the forefront and creating a space for those&#44; like me&#44; to play with it and even learn how to talk effectively to it. When I finally felt I had talking to a chatbot effectively mastered&#44; I loved being able to help others with learning how to use AI!
